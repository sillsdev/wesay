<H1>Welcome to WeSay <FONT COLOR="#c0504d">1.6.7</FONT></H1>
<HR>

<h2>What's New in 1.6?</h2>
<p>Version 1.6 provides a new feature to choose either <em>Definition</em>(default) or <em>Gloss</em> as the Meaning field. You can find the option in the WeSay Configuration tool in the configration of the Dictionary Browse and Edit task. Gloss is the preferred choice when sharing data with FLEx.</p>
<p>If you change the option it will not change existing data in WeSay. You can use the Bulk Edit feature of FLEx to copy or move data between Definition and Gloss.</p>

<p><NOTICE>1.6 includes a configuration change so if you open a project in 1.6 then you will not be able to open it again in 1.5. If you Send/Receive with 1.6 then colleagues using 1.5 will not be able to open the project.</NOTICE></p>

<h3>Common improvements</h3>
<p>Localizations of semantic domains for Arabic and Burmese.</p>
<p>Upgraded Chorus to the same version that is used by FLEx 8.3.11 which should improve Send/Receive</p>

<h3>Linux version</h3>
The mono framework used by the Linux version is now 4.6.1.1. This should bring small improvements. Please <a href="mailto:issues@wesay.org">let us know</a> if anything stops working or works less well.

<h3>Known issues on Windows</h3>
<p>Sound input systems do not work on some computers.</p>
<p>Spell checking will only work if you install <a href="http://downloads.sil.org/legacy/wesay/Enchant.1.4.2.1.msi">Enchant</a>. In the future we hope to add this to the WeSay installer.

<h3>Fixes</h3>
<p>WS-238 and WS-260: Do not show macrolanguages in language selection</p>
<p>WS-356: SFM export from WeSay could not handle diacritics in cross references</p>
<p>WS-458: Crash if keyboard not found on Linux</p>
<p>WS-464: Send-Receive PDF file not found via link in Create new project from a set of plain LIFT files</p>
<p>WS-467: WeSay loses changes to the non-meaning field</p>
<p>WS-471: Handle "cannot write to PDF" if it is already open more gracefully</p>
<p>WS-472: Default to Gloss if project is received from a FLEx repository</p>

<p>Consider joining the <a href="https://community.software.sil.org/c/wesay">WeSay Language Software Community</a> site. &#160; Until we have real documentation, this is the place to go when something is unclear.&#160; As you ask questions, we'll answer them there.&#160; You can read old questions and answers there. </p>

<p>Please report bugs or request a feature using <a href="mailto:issues@wesay.org">email</a>. Tell us that you tried it and what you did.&#160; No, really.&#160; It's human nature to assume someone else had the same crash, but if it was easy to run into, we would have found it, and we would have fixed it.&#160;&#160;&#160; When you send to this address, your issue is automatically entered into our &quot;todo list&quot; and you will get updates as we work on the problem.</p>

<p>We are adding to WeSay's abilities regularly, and publishing new versions <a href="http://software.sil.org/wesay/download/" target="_blank">here</a>.&#160; Major new features are always announced on <a href="https://software.sil.org/wesay/news/">the WeSay news.</a></p>
