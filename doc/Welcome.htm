</div>

<p class="MsoNormal">You have installed a <em>development version</em> of WeSay.&#160; This is a team effort, and <span style="color: #9bbb59">we really appreciate</span> your willingness to give WeSay a spin and send us feedback.&#160; </p>

<h1 class="Section1">About this version</h1>

<p class="MsoNormal">WeSay comes in two flavors: “stable” (even numbered ones) and “development” (odd numbered ones).&#160;&#160; The even versions receive critical bug fixes, but not new features or anything risky.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">If crashes or other bugs would be a major problem for you, please uninstall this version and get our most recent <a href="http://wesay.org/downloads">0.8.xxxx one</a>.&#160; If you are helping us advance WeSay, are evaluating WeSay’s capabilities, or are just willing to risk the occasional bug, this is the version for you.&#160; This is where we are currently adding new abilities in response to your requests, and we need people to help ensure that it can become stable, too. Eventually, we will retire 0.8 and 0.9 will be relabeled “1.0 - Stable”. Note that at times we post new “odd” versions almost daily.&#160; If you report a bug via <a href="mailto:issues@wesay.org"><span style="line-height: 115%; font-family: &#39;Tahoma&#39;,&#39;sans-serif&#39;; font-size: 12pt">issues@wesay.org</span></a>, we can often times fix it and provide a new release within hours.&#160; So let us know if you’re in a hurry for a fix.</p>

<h1 class="Section1">What’s New in 0.9?</h1>

<h3>Printing</h3>

<p class="MsoNormal">WeSay has long provided one-click creation of PDF dictionaries. If you don’t like the default layout, you can even use FLEx to make custom CSS stylesheets that <a href="http://WeSay.org">WeSay</a> will use, so that it “just works” for the <a href="http://WeSay.org">WeSay</a> user.&#160; However, that method does not work for some languages with complex non-roman scripts. So now <a href="http://WeSay.org">WeSay</a> provides the option to create an <a href="http://openoffice.org">OpenOffice</a> Writer document.&#160; This removes the previous limitations, since Open Office includes SIL’s advanced <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphite_%28SIL%29">Graphite</a> font technology.</p>

<h3>Increased Standardization</h3>

<p class="MsoNormal">The Palaso team is continually working to make WeSay conform to various file standards in order to ease integration with other tools you use, like FLEx (<a href="http://www.sil.org/computing/fieldworks/flex/" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.sil.org/computing/fieldworks/flex/" target="_blank">FieldWorks Language Explorer</a></a>).&#160;&#160; With this release, <a href="http://WeSay.org">WeSay</a> now uses industry-standard LDML (“Locale Data Markup Language”) to store writing system information, rather than its own xml format.&#160; You’ll only notice a difference if you’re exchanging data with FLEx, which has also switched to this format.</p>

<h1 class="Section1">What’s New in 0.7?</h1>

<h3>Word Packs</h3>

<p class="MsoNormal">Previously, WeSay offered a task for eliciting simple word lists.&#160; As you entered a word, WeSay made a dictionary entry of it and used the elicitation word for the definition.&#160; Now, with Word Packs, that word list can be an entire template dictionary.&#160; For example, with the included “<a href="http://www.sil.org/silewp/abstract.asp?ref=2006-005" target="_blank">SIL Comparative African Wordlist</a>” Word Pack, when you enter a word, the newly created entry gets a part of speech, semantic domains, glosses in several languages, and a reference to the SIL-CAWL item.&#160; Additionally, since Word Packs are multilingual, you can elicit words from SIL-CAWL in English, French, Hausa, Portuguese, Swahili.</p>

<h3 class="Section1">Team Collaboration using Send/Receive &amp; Chorus</h3>

<p class="MsoNormal">WeSay promotes teamwork beyond what people normally do with dictionary applications. Starting with WeSay 0.7,&#160; multiple team members in the same office or around the world can work on the same dictionary, whether they are connected to the internet always, occasionally, or never.&#160; If two people edit the same thing at the same time, <a href="http://WeSay.org">WeSay</a> does its best to merge their work; if it can’t automatically deal with a conflict, it just chooses one person’s work, makes a note of what happened, and then allows any member of the team, anywhere, to see what happened and fix up the entry if needed.&#160; WeSay does this using <a href="http://projects.palaso.org/projects/show/chorus">Chorus</a>, a software toolbox we’ve created to support collaboration in language development projects. You’ll see elements of Chorus showing up in other language software applications like FieldWorks, Paratext, OurWord, and OneStory Editor.&#160; Using the new Chorus-enabled WeSay, you can:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Get automatic <em>incremental</em> backups of your work which would allow reversing back to any previous stage (would require technical help).</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Send your changes to an <a href="http://languagdepot.org" target="_blank">internet server</a>, USB key, or local server, and receive changes from your colleagues.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">See a history of who has done what to the dictionary.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Leave questions for teammates, who can answer them. When everything is ok, you can mark the issue as “resolved”.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&#160;</p>

<h3 class="Section1">What Now?</h3>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none">Get your head around WeSay… it’s really different.&#160; It’s aimed at empowering a very different user than you are, and approaches the task of dictionary making in a new, super-task-oriented way.&#160; Using the provided samples, play around with both WeSay and the WeSay Configuration Tool.&#160; To do this, go to your Windows Start menu and find “WeSay”.&#160; Choose one of the icons there which open the sample project.</span></p>

<h2>Documentation</h2>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none">Currently, we keep the documentation as a separate download.&#160; You can get it and read more advanced help topics on our wiki, <a href="http://wesay.org/wiki/Help_And_Contact">here</a>.</span></p>

<h3>Ready to go deeper?</h3>

<p>Consider joining the <a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/wesay">Google Group</a>. You can either use this group from your browser, through your email client, or a mix of both.&#160; Until we have real documentation, this is the place to go when something is unclear.&#160; As you ask questions, we’ll answer them there.&#160; A Google Group is a mailing list, but one that you can choose to have sent to your email box or wait for you to browse on the web, your choice. You can read old questions and answers. </p>

<p>Please report a bugs or request a feature using <a href="mail://issues@wesay.org">email</a>. Tell us that you tried it and what you did.&#160; No, really.&#160; It’s human nature to assume someone else had the same crash… but if it was easy to run into, we would have found it, and we would have fixed it.&#160;&#160;&#160; When you send to this address, your issue is automatically entered into our &quot;todo list&quot; and you will get updates as we work on the problem.</p>

<p>We are adding to WeSay's abilities regularly, and publishing new versions <a href="http://wesay.org/downloads" target="_blank">here</a>.&#160; Major new features are always announced on <a href="http://blogs.wesay.org">the blog.</a></p>
