<H1>Welcome to WeSay <FONT COLOR="#c0504d">1.1.x Linux Development release</FONT></H1>
<HR>
<p class="MsoNormal">You have installed a <em>development version</em> of WeSay.&#160; This is a team effort, and <span style="color: #9bbb59">we really appreciate</span> your willingness to give WeSay a spin and send us feedback.&#160; </p>

<h1 class="Section1">About this version</h1>

<p class="MsoNormal">WeSay comes in two flavors: 'stable' (even numbered ones) and 'development' (odd numbered ones).&#160;&#160; The even versions receive critical bug fixes, but not new features or anything risky.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">If you are helping us advance WeSay, are evaluating WeSay's capabilities, or are just willing to risk the occasional bug, this is the version for you.&#160; This is where we are currently adding new abilities in response to your requests, and we need people to help ensure that it can become stable, too. Eventually, we will retire 1.0 and 1.1 will be relabeled '1.2 - Stable'. Note that at times we post new 'odd' versions almost daily.&#160; If you report a bug via <a href="mailto:issues@wesay.org">issues@wesay.org</a>, we can often times fix it and provide a new release within hours.&#160; So let us know if you're in a hurry for a fix.</p>

<h1 class="Section1">What's New in 1.1?</h1>

<h3>Improved FLEx Collaboration</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">We have made various changes to smooth the process of sharing data with FLEx. Internally, these have required a lot of work, but on the surface, you won't see much of a change.</p>

<h3>Completely new "Input Systems" tab</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">In the Configuration Tool, the old "Writing Systems" tab has been replaced with an "Input Systems" one which is both easier and more powerful.  For example, adding a system to hold ipa or audio recordings is now done with a single click.</p>

<h3>Indonesian "Art Of Reading"</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">When you click "Find Picture" to choose and image from "Art Of Reading", you can now type in Indonesian search terms</p>

<h3>Send/Receive Improvements</h3>
<p>The Send/Receive system now offers more help when it detects common problems, like a mistyped password.</p>
	<p>You can now set up Send/Receive with a LAN server/networked drive.</p>

<h3>Usability Improvements</h3>
<p>Previously, if WeSay could not figure out what project to open, it just told you "sorry".  Now, it
	tells you &quot;Welcome to WeSay&quot; and then runs the Configuration Tool, where you can
	find the project or create a new one.</p>

<h3>Configuration Tool hand-off to WeSay</h3>
<p>Previously, it was possible to leave the WeSay Configuration Tool running while you ran WeSay; this could lead to confusion and potentially lost changes.  Now, when you click "Open
	in WeSay", the Configuration Tool closes first.&nbsp; Then, in order to make it
	easy to get back to the Configuration tool, a &quot;Configure this project...&quot; button
	appears at the bottom of the WeSay window.&nbsp; Note: when you run WeSay any
	other way, this button is hidden, since you don't normally want WeSay users
	messing with the configuration.&nbsp; As before, you can still right-click on
	the WeSay Home page to get that same command.</p>
<h3>Printing Improvement</h3>
<p>A team in language with digraphs ("th", "ng") wanted words starting with these letters to be grouped together.
	Note, it is not enough to make them <emph>sort</emph> together;
	we need a way for you to explicitly identify these clusters of letters.  Doing
	that should eventually be part of setting up an <emph>input system</emph>.
	But for now, you can identify them by listing the multigraphs, one-per-line, in a file named "multigraphs.txt" in the "export" directory of the WeSay project.  </p>
<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<p>Fixed: homographs that were collected in the same session using the "Gather By Wordlist" task not saved, if you quit before going to another task.</p>
<p>Fixed: Spell checking not enabled for meaning field in gather by Semantic Domains</p>
<p>Fixed: In fields configuration control there were enabled settings that don't make sense for the current datatype, or were not appropriate to change for built-in fields.</p>
	<p>Fixed: When a language project had spaces in its name,&nbsp; Notes didn't work.</p>

<h1 class="Section1">What Now?</h1>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none">Get your head around WeSay' it's really different.&#160; It's aimed at empowering a very different user than you are, and approaches the task of dictionary making in a new, super-task-oriented way.&#160; Using the provided samples, play around with both WeSay and the WeSay Configuration Tool.&#160; To do this, go to your Windows Start menu and find 'WeSay'.&#160; Choose one of the icons there which open the sample project.</span></p>

<h1>Documentation</h1>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: windowtext; text-decoration: none">Currently, we keep the documentation as a separate download.&#160; You can get it and read more advanced help topics on our wiki, <a href="http://wesay.org/wiki/Help_And_Contact">here</a>.</span></p>

<p>Consider joining the <a href="http://groups-beta.google.com/group/wesay">Google Group</a>. You can either use this group from your browser, through your email client, or a mix of both.&#160; Until we have real documentation, this is the place to go when something is unclear.&#160; As you ask questions, we'll answer them there.&#160; A Google Group is a mailing list, but one that you can choose to have sent to your email box or wait for you to browse on the web, your choice. You can read old questions and answers. </p>

<p>Please report a bugs or request a feature using <a href="mail://issues@wesay.org">email</a>. Tell us that you tried it and what you did.&#160; No, really.&#160; It's human nature to assume someone else had the same crash' but if it was easy to run into, we would have found it, and we would have fixed it.&#160;&#160;&#160; When you send to this address, your issue is automatically entered into our &quot;todo list&quot; and you will get updates as we work on the problem.</p>

<p>We are adding to WeSay's abilities regularly, and publishing new versions <a href="http://wesay.org/downloads" target="_blank">here</a>.&#160; Major new features are always announced on <a href="http://wesay.org/blogs">the blog.</a></p>
